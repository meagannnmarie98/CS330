When designing software I like to write out and brainstorm my ideas. After I write out the application idea I go into depth on which features I need for my vision to come to life. Writing down all the elements helps me better plan the design process and the steps I need to be successful with my software. I learned a lot of new design skills on this project my favorite element was adding textures to objects. This really helped bring my vision to life and gave the 3D scene a realistic feel. Each week I took the material I learned and encorprated it into my code. Each week I built off the prior lessons and it helped merge all of the elements together to create a interactive scene. Throughout all of my classes I have learned so many new tools that I can apply to my current job in IT and as well as my future goals of developing software. I will use all of these tools and encorporate it into all of my future projects throughout my career.
